NUFFT - nonuniform FFT toolbox for Matlab
by Jeff Fessler, Brad Sutton, and Yingying Zhang

This directory contains a Matlab toolbox for computing nonuniform
fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) for unequally spaced samples.
The interpolation methods have been optimized by a min-max criterion
that minimizes the worst-case error.

This work was inspired by collaboration on MR imaging with Doug Noll.
