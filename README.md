# CS_LAB
Compressed Sensing LAB: An MR acquisition and reconstruction system

Generate a Compressed Sensing (CS) accelerated MR sequence and reconstruct the acquired data online on the scanner by means of Gadgetron or offline on an external workstation.

## Acquistion
- Generic subsampling class for Compressed Sensing acquisitions
- precompiled CS accelerated gradient echo sequence: CS_FLASH (Siemens, VB20P)

## Reconstruction
- CS reconstruction system for Gadgetron (C++)
- CS reconstruction system in Matlab (including a GUI)
